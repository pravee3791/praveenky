  "content": "JSON Web Tokens (JWT) operate by encoding user information into a secure token comprised of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.The header typically specifies the hashing algorithm used for signature creation. The payload contains the user data, such as user ID or role. This payload is then signed with a secret key known only to the server, ensuring its integrity and allowing servers to verify the authenticity of the token upon receiving it.The header of a JWT typically consists of metadata about the token itself, including the type of token (which is usually JWT) and the hashing algorithm used to secure it. Common hashing algorithms used in JWT are HMAC SHA256 and RSA. This header is encoded in Base64Url format and is part of what makes JWT self-contained and portable.The payload of a JWT contains the actual data being transmitted, such as user information or authorization claims. This payload is also encoded in Base64Url format and can include standard claims (defined by the JWT specification) as well as custom claims specific to the application. Standard claims often include information like the issuer (iss), subject (sub), expiration time (exp), and audience (aud) of the token.Once the header and payload are created, they are combined and signed using the specified algorithm and a secret key known only to the server. This signature ensures the integrity of the JWT, as any tampering with the header or payload would result in a mismatch during verification. The signature is also encoded in Base64Url format.Upon receiving a JWT, the server can validate its authenticity by recalculating the signature using the same algorithm and secret key. If the recalculated signature matches the one provided in the token, the server can trust the integrity and authenticity of the data contained within the JWT. This process allows for secure transmission of user data across different parts of an application or between different services."
